* Notes
Maybe could be interesting to have all the commands to be run for a specific "variant" in the config file, in the form of json array?

The above proposition would give the user all the control, we just have the infraestructure to make it happen; we keep the scope small, we check whether the --keyboard device is connected and change the layout according with the config file or arguments.

** TODO Should we enforce having a config file?
